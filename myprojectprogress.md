Well, I have not looked at any projects on github, but my Logic course has mentioned several different systems that need developement. Over the years, past students have created and edited different logic software and I need to ask the professor for the sourse code that they created. I think I will start with the software that has been created for Truth Trees and modify it to accomidate Davis-Putnum procedures.
